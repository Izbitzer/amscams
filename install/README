ALLSKYCAMS ADMIN

Before you install, you must obtain an AMS ID and PIN Code from allsky.com. 

If you do not already have it contact mike.hankey@gmail.com to request an AMS ID and pin code for your station.

To install on a fresh ubuntu first 

Then run:

sudo ./AS7Setup.py

After running the install. To access the web admin and check your captures, open google chrome and goto :

Follow the menu items. 

( NOTE: If you know how to setup your own network IPs and disk you can skip these steps. )

The most important step is #4 config to setup the stations variables. Other steps can be done manually. 

You can also update your station info latter in the web browser. So these values can be blank and filled in later from the web admin. 
         
To access the web admin in a browswer goto:

http://localhost/

login as your AMSXX id and use the password "meteors"

For trouble shooting to see if a cam is still up:

open terminal (black dos looking box)

type:

ping 192.168.76.71

(or whatever camera IP address you want to check)

Press [CNTL-C] to exit.


NETWORK SETUP

to add a route to your normal PC for the camera network port so that you can access the camera feeds on your network:

For Windows:
open a DOS prompt as administrator

type:

route add 192.168.76.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 IP_OF_LINUX

where IP_OF_LINUX is this host's IP address. To figure that out, open the terminal and type:

ip a 

then look for something like 192.168.x.x


CAMERA ADMIN
Each camera has its own web admin you can use to access the settings or view the live feed, BUT this admin only works in the OLD Internet Explorer.
Win10 has a verion of this, but you have to search for "Internet Explorer"

Once in IE, go to the cam IP address. 

Login with username : admin 
and no password (blank password)
