====================================================================================

Pass 1 uses a pre PSF convolved image array and hypothesizes line segment templates,  
   so it is computationally fast and lots of particles can be used. 

Pass 2 uses a line segment template that is convolved with the PSF per hypothesis, 
   so it is computationally slow and fewer particles should be used.
